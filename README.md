# Docker home environment.
The Docker home environment is a set of Docker and Docker Compose utilities that can be reused across multiple projects. It is designed to facilitate local development by wrapping third-party services in containers, thereby enabling developers to reuse them without having to install them on their local development environment. This creates a shared environment for different projects that use commonly used services like MongoDB and others.
